# nobody audits is the leak the method cannot see.

# Installs three diagnostic agents and one canary skill, runs five arms through
# the true sub-agent spawn path, prints a result matrix, and removes everything
# it created. It refuses to overwrite anything that already exists.

Each arm varies exactly ONE thing from arm A. An arm that varies two
cannot attribute its own result.

  arm  SKILL_CANARY  CLAUDEMD_CANARY  BODY_CANARY   what it establishes
  A    absent        $CLAUDEMD_CANARY   absent        baseline
  B    absent        $CLAUDEMD_CANARY   $BODY_CANARY  the return frame works  <- format control
  C    $SKILL_CANARY  $CLAUDEMD_CANARY   absent        a FOREIGN channel is detectable  <- positive control
  D    absent        $CLAUDEMD_CANARY   absent        parent-loaded skills do NOT cross
  E    absent        absent           absent        CLAUDE.md recovery was the file  <- negative control

NOTHING BELOW IS A RESULT. This script computes no verdict: it prints each arm's
output above, and the table above is what a version matching docs/FINDINGS.md
would return. Reading one against the other is yours to do.

Read the matrix before you read the conclusion:

  - C reports SKILL_CANARY absent
      -> the instrument cannot detect inheritance through a channel the ledger
         says is open. Every "absent" in every arm is then noise, not evidence.
         Note this is the positive control and arm B is NOT: a canary in the
         agent's own body never crosses a boundary at all, so B shows only that
         the return frame is honoured. A control at zero distance along the
         manipulated axis measures format compliance, not detection.
  - B reports BODY_CANARY absent
      -> the agent is not following its return frame; every row is unreadable
         for a reason that has nothing to do with the boundary. Fix the probe.
  - E recovers CLAUDEMD_CANARY
      -> a side channel is open, or the token is guessable. The CLAUDE.md
         result in A-D is contaminated. Fix the probe, not the finding.
  - D recovers SKILL_CANARY
      -> parent-loaded skill content crossed the boundary. That contradicts
         the isolation ledger this skill's mechanism rests on. Re-run before
         reporting it, then report it loudly.
  - A-D recover CLAUDEMD_CANARY and E does not
      -> CLAUDE.md is an open channel into every player. A self-play run must
         audit CLAUDE.md for the hypothesis, not just the player prompts.
         This is discipline 1 ("the channel moves") with an address.
  - ALL rows absent, including B
      -> suspect the harness, not the runtime.
